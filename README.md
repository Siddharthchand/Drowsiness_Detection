# Drowsiness_Detection
Drowsiness detection is a crucial process used to determine if a person is feeling sleepy while engaged in important tasks. This detection has wide-ranging applications, particularly in medical and safety domains. In Python, this detection can be efficiently performed using OpenCV modules, leveraging the "shape predictor face landmarks" to mark key points on the face.

With Python's flexibility and the capabilities offered by OpenCV, individuals can develop their own drowsiness detection system using a phone camera. The provided code snippet below demonstrates how this can be achieved:
